Covid19, popularly known as the CoronaVirus, is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus is spread mainly through close contact and via respiratory droplets produced when people cough or sneeze. Since WHO has declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, being global citizens, it is our utmost responsibility to take all the preventive measures to contain this situation.</div><br></br><div class="paragraph">Below are the list of precautions that you should be doing right now to protect yourself from the ongoing pandemic.</div><br></br><div class="heading">Safety and Prevention Measures</div><div class="paragraph">Now that most of us are in home isolation, the first step is to follow this strictly. Stay indoors and keep social distancing as much as you can unless you need to step out to buy necessities.</div><br></br><div class="heading">Now what to do if you have to step out?</div> * Maintain your social distance outside (at least 1 metre) * Use hand gloves and masks (disposable or N95) * Avoid touching any part of your face like mouth, eyes or nose when your hands are not clean. * Avoid touching in public places, as much as you can, like elevators, ATMs, door handles etc or use hand sanitizers immediately after touching. * Cover your mouth and nose with tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing.<br></br><div class="heading">What to do after you reach home?</div> * Wash your hands with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub. * Make sure to dispose of the gloves and masks properly.<br></br><div class="heading">Follow these actions while your at home:</div> 1. Maintain your social distance outside (at least 1 metre) 1. Start eating healthy foods more than ever, especially consume more food that enhances your immune system 1. Your phone is like your third hand, hence clean your mobile phones at least once a day with alcohol wipes. 1. Start practising good respiratory hygiene. 1. Do not allow visitors into your home 1. Keep daily track of your health conditions manually or use the Muse Health Tracker to get a full report of your physical condition. 1. It's okay to feel anxious and get frustrated. However, learn to calm your mind and emotions by doing meditations, exercise etc. 1. More than the virus, fear is spreading faster. Always get your information about Covid-19 from authentic sites like WHO and other credible news sites. 1. Now that you have plenty of time, make use of this time to learn new skills, pick up a new hobby, exercise more. This will eventually help you in your life even after once this is all over.<br></br><div class="paragraph">At the end of the day it's the sole responsibility of each individual. The situation today can change overnight either for better or for worse . Hence all we have to do is be alert, be calm and stay indoors.</div><br></br></body></html>
